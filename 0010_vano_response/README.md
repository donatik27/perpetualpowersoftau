Entropy sources: I have used the last four block hashes from Horizen blockchain at the time of calculation + the last block hash of Bitcoin blockchain + random key mash on keyboard.

Time taken: around 9 hours

Side channel defenses: I have not told anyone what I was going to do. The VM had disk encrypted.

Postprocessing:

I copied the Blake2b hash from the CLI output of compute_constrained;
I did not reboot the VM;
I uploaded the response file as "response" using SFTP to the server provided by Wei Jie.
I rebooted the VM;
I deleted the VM.
```
